\toprule
\tabcaption{Element} & \tabcaption{Mobile} & \tabcaption{Traditional} \\ \midrule

Test recording
    &
    Lack of programmatic access to recording GUI events.
    Emulation of user interaction impossible.
    &
    Standard \texttt{java.awt.Robot} class
    for recording GUI events. \\ \addlinespace[1mm]

Deployment automation
    &
    Tedious (manual) routine of on-device deployment and
    testing.
    & 
    Deployment usually fully automatic. Testing and harvesting
    test results automatic and relatively easy. 
    \\ \addlinespace[1mm]

Test environment differences
    &
    Differences across devices (different JVMs, varying memory and resource availability).
    Requirement to run tests on all possible configurations.
    &
    Virtually identical development and deployment/ testing
    environment. In very rare cases operating-system specific. \\ \addlinespace[1mm]

Programming interfaces 
    &
    A number of non-standard APIs and proprietary
    solutions (playing sounds, access to external ports, access to 
    the current display). 
    &
    More mature and standard APIs, portable across JVMs
    from different vendors. \\
