		<h1>RobotME</h1>
		<h2>Event capturing and event generation mechanism</h2>



		<h3>Glossary of terms</h3>

		<dl>
			<dt><b>target code</b>, <b>application code</b></dt>
			<dd>Bytecode (compiled classes) of the application
				to be tested. The classes are prior to preverification step.</dd>

			<dt><b>template classes</b></dt>
			<dd>Classes implementing functionality required to generate
				and capture events. These classes are part of the RobotME
				application. They contain methods with signatures
				identical to those they wish to "override" in the target code.
				RobotME application rewrites application code and substitutes
				methods with identical signatures with template method implementations,
				renaming original methods using a predefined naming convention.

		<h3>Event generation/ capturing -- implementation concepts</h3>
		<p>
			Event capturing and generation requires that we somehow
			access internals of classes inside a midlet suite. Ideally,
			we would like to capture and generate events <b>without
			changing</b> anything in the target code -- including class inheritance
			hierarchy.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The current implementation <b>modifies the target code</b> by rewriting
			all methods of the super class we want to capture events from. Let's say
			we are interested in the <code>Canvas</code> class. The target
			code contains a subclass of the <code>Canvas</code> class overriding
			<code>paint(Graphics)</code>method:
		</p>

		<pre>
/**
 * A custom class extending {@link Canvas} directly.
 */
public final class CustomCanvas extends Canvas {
    private final String title;
    private int lastKeyCode;

    public CustomCanvas() {
        this.title = "Hello world.";
    }

    protected final void paint(Graphics graphics) {
        final int x = graphics.getClipX();
        final int y = graphics.getClipY();
        final int w = graphics.getClipWidth();
        final int h = graphics.getClipHeight();

        graphics.setColor(0x000000);
        graphics.fillRect(x, y, w, h);

        graphics.setColor(0xa0a0a0a0);
        graphics.drawString(title, getWidth()/2, getHeight()/2, Graphics.BASELINE | Graphics.HCENTER);

        graphics.setColor(0x50a0f0);
        graphics.drawString("Last keycode: " + lastKeyCode,
                getWidth()/2, 0, Graphics.TOP | Graphics.HCENTER);
    }

    protected void keyPressed(int keyCode) {
        lastKeyCode = keyCode;
        repaint();
    }
}</pre>

		<p>
			There are a few problems with adding the robot code to the above example
			(for capturing and generating events):
			<ul>
				<li><b>Subclassing.</b> Final methods and classes cannot be overriden. Even after removing the final attribute
				we still have to rewrite all casts, object creations and method invocations to use our subclass.</li>
				<li><b>Delegation to a separate class.</b> We could inject the code to delegate all method calls to a third
				class. But we would still encounter issues with triggering events on protected and package-scope methods (inaccessible
				from outside of the package scope).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>One solution to the above problems is to rewrite the target class, <em>substituting methods of interest</em> with
		our custom implementations. The original code of the target class needs to be moved to another method (preferably final
			and private) so that it can be still invoked (both as a consequence of a system call and a simulated event).</p>
		<p>
		Potential code injection performing such <em>internal, injected delegation</em> is shown in the code snippet below
			(<span class="injected">red-tinted</span> code blocks have been automatically injected, 
			<span class="original">green-tinted</span> code blocks come from the original target code)</p>
<pre>
    protected void keyPressed(int i)
    {
<span class="injected">        System.out.println("Key pressed (captured): " + i);
        robot$keyPressed(i);</span>
    }

<span class="injected">    protected final void robot$keyPressed(int i)
    {</span>
<span class="original">        lastKeyCode = i;
        repaint();</span>
    }

<span class="injected">    public void robot$fireKeyPressed(int i)
    {
        System.out.println("Key pressed (simulation): " + i);
        robot$keyPressed(i);
    }</span>
</pre>
		
		<p>
			The above delegation model can be used to redirect call method control from any target class method
			-- even private or final methods. We can also invoke such methods from the outside code using public
			interfaces dynamically added to the target class signature:
		</p>
<pre>
public final class CustomCanvas extends Canvas 
	<span class="injected">implements IRobotized, IRobotizedCanvas</span>
{
...
</pre>
		<p>
			where <code>IRobotizedCanvas</code> contains a public signatures for event generation methods and
			other utility methods needed to automate script replay:
		</p>
<pre>
public interface IRobotizedCanvas extends IRobotized {
    /**
     * Fires key pressed event programmatically. 
     */
    public void robot$fireKeyPressed(int keyCode);
}	
</pre>

		<h3>Things still to be solved</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>When to begin script replay? I assume we may simply inject
				the required code into a <code>Midlet</code> subclass (its constructor?),
				and then capture all changes to the display, simply casting to our
				robotized interfaces.
				</li>
				<li>Memory usage. I wouldn't worry about it. As a testing tool this won't
				matter much.</li>
			</ul>
